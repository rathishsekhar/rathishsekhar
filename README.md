### Hi there ðŸ‘‹!!!  I am Rathish Sekhar

Hi, I'm Rathish Sekhar - a data science professional who has navigated my way to this field after working as a socio-economic researcher dealing with massive amounts of data. I am well versed in Python, STATA and SQL and love to research and bring structure to unstructured problems. My past experience includes working in a SaaS technology company where I dealt with data in all of the positions. With good business acumen and client handling abilities, most of my projects have scaled up to 4X - 10X. 

When I'm not working on data science projects, I enjoy making beer - IPAs, porters, and stouts are my favorites. I also love tending to plants, my miniature mushroom garden, and vermicompost.
